# Build and Save Ships
Basically, I was saddened to see that the base game has just basic ships that have no real objective to them and can be just a simple stick with an engine and a reactor and whatnot on them.  I wanted to expand upon the ship system and have a functional ship design that looks and seems logical.  I also wanted players to be able to make a ship look more like a place one might live in for a period, or like you might expect a trade ship to look like.  So I have goals to add lots of new content in the form of ship parts and various different qualities of existing ship parts as well.

# Current stuff in the mod:
- 3 styles of reactors.
- Modular ship hull.
- Internal cryostasis structures.
- Airlock style doors.
- Ship computer made to interior.

# Plans for the future
Ship hull roofing will be buildable the same way you build roofing in Expanded Roofing mod.

Ships will require at least 2-4 engines before they can fly, no more single engine ships.  Possibly may even make this dependant on the ship's calculated mass.

Multiple engine sizes for different looks and styles of ships.

A ship locker that can store materials for a long journey in a safe reliable and compact way.

Ship related heating and cooling systems.

Possibly solar ship hull for extra power in a compact area.

Possibly ship batteries with improved storage and efficiency.

Considering RTG style power generators.

Considering stasis nuclear power, a power generation method that keeps the fuel in stasis then when needed, takes it out of stasis to activate the power generation method giving you heavy power for a duration of time.  Would be a super late late game feat.

Will incorporate special Tiberium related stuff into the mod when ready and in a stable working method, working with the Tib mod dev to make some special tib related ship parts.

Considering ship beds, bunk beds, and other ship room related object.

Thin interior ship doors that take very little power.
